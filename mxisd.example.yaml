# Matrix config items #
#######################
# Matrix domain, same as the domain configure in your Homeserver configuration.
# NOTE: in Synapse Homeserver, the Matrix domain is defined as 'server_name' in configuration file.
#
# This is used to build the various identifiers in all the features.
#
# If the hostname of the public URL used to reach your Matrix services is different from your Matrix domain,
# per example matrix.domain.tld vs domain.tld, then use the server.name configuration option.
# See the "Configure" section of the Getting Started guide for more info.

# During testing, /var/tmp/mxisd/keys is a possible value
# For production, recommended location shall be one of the following:
#   - /var/lib/mxisd/keys
#   - /var/opt/mxisd/keys
#   - /var/local/mxisd/keys
